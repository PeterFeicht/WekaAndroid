# WekaAndroid

Obsolete: I made this for a university project years ago and it's preserved here for posterity.

-------------

This project is a library for Android that currently contains the Weka classifiers `NaiveBayes`, `J48` and `IBk`.

You can include this in your Android application if you want to use those classifiers.
